function expr = make_regexp(key, type)
        % returns proper regular expression for line key, matrix and section.
        % this function is mainly to have all regular expressions at one place to increase
        % readability of the whole library.

        % GNU Octave and LabVIEW use PCRE (Pearl Compatible Regular Expressions), however Matlab
        % seems to have it's own regular expression flavor (unfortunately).

        % Matlab issues:
        % 1,
        % https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/regexp.html#btn_p45_sep_shared-expression
                % WARNING!
                % If an expression has nested parentheses, MATLAB captures tokens that correspond
                % to the outermost set of parentheses. For example, given the search pattern
                % '(and(y|rew))', MATLAB creates a token for 'andrew' but not for 'y' or 'rew'.
        % so for Octave one can keep proper non matching group (?:), but not for Matlab.
        % 2,
        % For Matlab, \h has to be replaced by \s. But \s matches also newlines contrary to \h

        key = regexpescape(strtrim(key));
